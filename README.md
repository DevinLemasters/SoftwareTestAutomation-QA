# SoftwareTestAutomation-QA
Projects from my studies in my CS-320 Software Test Automation&amp; QA class

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
My code is tested to be functional and secure through the use of JUnit tests. These tests have allowed me to verify that all my code is 100% tested through the coverage indicater in my test cases. This means that I have covered every line of code when testing functionality and security.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by collecting all the information from the user. After that, I think about all the requirements the user presented and think about how I would approach a solution. Once an idea of how things should run are established, I direclty translate the user needs into code.
 
# How do I approach designing software?
I design software by getting the whole picture of how the program should work. I first start with how I would want the software results to work and look. Then I work towards developing the code to match those result.
